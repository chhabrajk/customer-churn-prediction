## 🎯 Business Problem

A SaaS or telecom company loses **thousands of dollars per churned customer** every month.
The problem isn't churn itself — it's that companies find out *after* the customer leaves.

**This project builds a model that flags at-risk customers before they churn,**
giving retention teams time to intervene.

## 📊 What It Does

- Ingests customer data (tenure, contract type, charges, support calls, etc.)
- Cleans, engineers features, and prepares the ML-ready dataset
- Trains and compares **3 models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Evaluates using **AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall, F1** and 5-fold cross-validation
- Generates a **6-panel analytics dashboard** saved as PNG
- Outputs clear **business recommendations** from model findings

## 📈 Model Results

| Model | AUC | CV-AUC |
|-------|-----|--------|
| Logistic Regression | ~0.82 | ~0.81 |
| Random Forest | ~0.91 | ~0.90 |
| **Gradient Boosting** ✅ | **~0.93** | **~0.92** |

> Results vary slightly with random seed. Gradient Boosting consistently wins on this dataset.

## 🔍 Key Features Driving Churn

1. **Contract Type** — Month-to-Month customers churn at ~3x the rate of annual contracts
2. **Tenure** — Customers with < 12 months tenure are highest risk
3. **Support Calls** — 3+ calls/month is a strong churn signal
4. **Payment Delays** — Late payments correlate strongly with upcoming churn

## 💡 Business Recommendation Generated

```
Customers on Month-to-Month contracts with < 12 months tenure
are ~65% likely to churn.

→ Priority retention campaigns should target this segment.
→ Offer contract upgrade incentives at month 10-11.
→ Flag customers with 3+ support calls for proactive outreach.
